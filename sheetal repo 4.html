// Module 4 Assignment Instructions.
//
// The idea of this assignment is to take an existing array of names
// and then output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
// The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J"
// or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". So, the final output
// on the console should look like this:
/*
Hello Yaakov
Good Bye John
Good Bye Jen
Good Bye Jason
Hello Paul
Hello Frank
Hello Larry
Hello Paula
Hello Laura
Good Bye Jim
WARNING!!! WARNING!!!
The code does NOT currently work! It is YOUR job to make it work

// See Lecture 52, part 2

// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
// var byeSpeaker =

// byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 9: Expose the 'byeSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
// 'byeSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
